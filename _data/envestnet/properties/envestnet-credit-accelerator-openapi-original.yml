These tokens are the simplest and easiest of several alternatives for authenticating with Yodlee servers.<br>The most commonly used services obtain data specific to an end user (your customer). For these services, you need a <b>user access token</b>. These are simply tokens created with the user name parameter (<b>loginName</b>) set to the id of your end user.  <i><br><br><b>Note:</b> You determine this id and you must ensure it's unique among all your customers.</i> <br><br>Each token issued has an associated user. The token passed in the http headers explicitly names the user referenced in that API call.<br><br>Some of the APIs do administrative work, and don't reference an end user. <br/>One example of administrative work is key management. Another example is registering a new user explicitly, with <b>POST /user/register</b> call or subscribe to webhook, with <b>POST /config/notifications/events/{eventName}</b>. <br/>To invoke these, you need an <b>admin access token</b>. Create this by passing in your admin user login name in place of a regular user name.<br><br>This service also allows for simplified registration of new users. Any time you pass in a user name not already in use, the system will automatically implicitly create a new user for you. <br>This user will naturally have very few associated details. You can later provide additional user information by calling the <b>PUT user/register service</b>.<br><br><b>Notes:</b><ul><li>The header <code>Authorization</code> does not apply to this service.</li><li>The content type has to be passed as application/x-www-form-urlencoded.<li>Upgrading to client credential authentication requires infrastructure reconfiguration. <li>Customers wishing to switch from another authentication scheme to client credential authentication, please contact Yodlee Client Services.</li><li>Default expiry time of user access token and admin access token is 30 minutes.</li></ul>"
