      description: >
        Get the Fund Flows. One-day fund flows are calculated by subtracting the
        shares outstanding at previous close from the shares outstanding one day
        prior to close, and then multiplying the result by the net asset value
        (NAV) of one day prior to close.


        The fund flows calculation breaks down as follows - 

        (Shares Outstanding T0 - Shares Outstanding T-1) * NAV T-1

        While NAVs are routinely reported on a trade-day (T0) basis,
        industry-wide shares outstanding are a mixture of trade-day and next-day
        values. Trade-day values are not verified, as the actual
        creation/redemption activity takes place late in the evening, after NAVs
        and shares outstanding values have been published. The result is that
        multiple industry flows are calculated using unverified T0 values.

        FactSet has standardized all shares outstanding reporting on a next-day
        basis. To ensure that assets under management (AUM) and fund flows are
        synchronized, FactSet synchronizes shares outstanding values and changes
        with NAVs reported on the previous day, as the creations and redemptions
        used the previous day's reported NAVs as a transaction price. <p>For

      summary: Get Fund Flows for a requested date range and large list of ids
      description: >
        Get the Fund Flows. One-day fund flows are calculated by subtracting the
        shares outstanding at previous close from the shares outstanding one day
        prior to close, and then multiplying the result by the net asset value
        (NAV) of one day prior to close.


        The fund flows calculation breaks down as follows - 

        (Shares Outstanding T0 - Shares Outstanding T-1) * NAV T-1

        While NAVs are routinely reported on a trade-day (T0) basis,
        industry-wide shares outstanding are a mixture of trade-day and next-day
        values. Trade-day values are not verified, as the actual
        creation/redemption activity takes place late in the evening, after NAVs
        and shares outstanding values have been published. The result is that

            The Fund invests primarily in equity securities that Fund management
            believes are undervalued, which means that their prices are less
            than Fund management believes they are worth. Equity securities
            primarily consist of common stock, preferred stock, securities
            convertible into common stock, or securities or other instruments
            whose price is linked to the value of common stock. Fund management
            places particular emphasis on companies with below average
            price/earnings ratios that may pay above average dividends. The Fund
            invests primarily in common stock of U.S. companies, but the Fund
            may invest up to 25% of its total assets in the securities of
            foreign companies. The Fund focuses primarily on companies with
            market capitalizations of over $5 billion.
