    Gain access to 20+ years of comprehensive estimates and statistics of over
    250+ estimated metrics, including financial statement items, product
    segments, geosegments, and industry metrics. FactSet's consensus estimates
    are aggregated from a wide base of over 800+ contributors and cover over
    19,000 active companies across 90+ countries. Data returned can be accessed
    on the data frequencies based on quarterly, fiscal years, and calendar
    years. FactSet Estimates updates on a real time basis intraday (every 5
    minutes). Updating times vary based on earning season vs. non-earning season
    but the goal is to have the data available to the client within a few hours
    that FactSet receives updated information. Often times updates times can be
    much faster as FactSet has always been known as one of the fastest estimate
    providers in the market.

        Returns FactSet Estimates consensus data using rolling fiscal dates.
        <p>The rolling behavior causes fiscal year to automatically roll from
        one year to the next as the historical perspective date changes. The
        fiscal period rolls forward as of each period end. This endpoint is
        optimized to allow the request to simply include a relative fiscal
        period (e.g. use relativeFiscalStart integer 1 and periodicity ANN for
        next unreported fiscal year end), and then see what the consensus
        thought the "next fiscal year" estimates were through time as you "roll"
        back your perspective dates. This differs from locking down an absolute
        estimate period such as explicitly stating Fiscal Year 2019. This can be
        done in the fixed-consensus endpoint.</p>
