  title: Price Alerting API For Digital Portals
  description: >
    The Price Alerting API is designed to inform the users of an application
    directly about important changes in the data on the platform. The endpoint
    group *basic price alerting* deals with generation of alerts based on
    current price data. For notations, users can define an upper or lower limit
    and choose on which price type those limit conditions apply.


    Alerting uses the concepts of triggers and alerts.


    A trigger is an entity that is set up by an application to watch a certain
    condition in the market data around a financial instrument. The standard
    conditions that can be applied are lower limit and upper limit for the value
    of the price for a given financial instrument.


    When the condition of a trigger is met, an alert is created. Each alert thus
    represents one event where a trigger condition was met.


    An application can learn about the creation of alerts in two ways: The
    application can actively request the list of alerts (pull approach) or it
    can subscribe to the list of existing alerts. If a new alert is created,
    that list changes and the application is notified about the new alert with
    an update that contains the details on the new alert (push approach).


    The API supports both approaches. The push approach is realized most easily
    by using the subscription support that the client libraries provide.


    See the [Quotes API for Digital
    Portals](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/quotes-api-digital-portals)
    for access to detailed price information.


    Note: As part of the general trial access, endpoints to write data are
    excluded. For a description of the full alerting API, please work with a

    FactSet consultant and see https://endpointreference.factset.com.
